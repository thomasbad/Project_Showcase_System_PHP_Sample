# Project_Showcase_System_PHP_Sample

A simple PHP Website sample to create a simple final project showcase system with pure PHP, HTML and CSS without any PHP Framework, created because of my HKIT CS418 homework.
Very messy as rushing this within 4 days, needs to clean up before using it.

After import the db from showcasedb.sql, please make sure to create the account with below information:

(Please try to not edit anything inside, or revert the setting after editing, which would save me sometimes and help the others, thanks)
